                <p>Over the last few months, the Isekai Meta team has been tirelessly working on the launch of their flagship office. Located in Manila, PH, it will serve as the base of operations for all things Isekai Meta and Studio Sekai. The office is ready to staff 15-20 full-time employees, including several new animators and the entire core team. While we aren't sure of the entire office layout, we've already gotten several glances at the level of detail that has gone into its creation. This will be the perfect home for the team as they expand over the coming year.<p>

                <p>December is usually a wash in web2 and in life in general, so it was still nice to see the team and community be so active througout the holiday season. Around Christmas time the community welcomed dozens of new members and saw a massive spike in floor price, which isn't everything but is indicative of increased activity.  As the studio builds in 2023, we can't wait to see what new teasers, community events and holder utilities unfold. </p>
                <p> Thank you for reading and Happy New Year!</p>

                <h6 class="subHead">Faction Wars</h6>

                  <p>
                    Faction Wars were an exciting attempt at a series of Discord minigames, puzzles and challenges. It brought community members together in the form of 9 different factions - with a twist! Humans had the ability to pledge their allegiance to any faction, and owners of multiple tokens had the choice of multiple factions. This was the first real token mechanic we have seen from the team on their website, and it had a unique experience for each faction.
                    The main component of the war was the Sekai Hunt, and brought these new-found groups together to earn points for an unknown prize. Each day was made up of a challenge that unlocked a riddle upon completion. The first team to complete the riddle earned 100 points, followed by the second team at 90 points, and so on. Each quest was also worth 20 points and could be completed at any time.
                  </p>
                  <img id="sideModalPic" src="img/hunt.png" width="90%" alt="">
                  <p>
                    These challenges kept us busy and ultimately led to a really fun environment in Discord. Here are the final point toals from the Sekai Hunt:
                  </p>

                  <p>

                    <ol>
                      <li>Beasts: 963 points</li>
                      <li>Demons: 844 points</li>
                      <li>Puppets: 794 points</li>
                      <li>Humans: 755 points</li>
                      <li>Jellies: 714 points</li>
                      <li>Mechs: 628 points</li>
                      <li>Angels: 474 points</li>
                      <li>Zombies: 452 points</li>
                      <li>Dragons: 275 points</li>
                    </ol>

                  </p>

                  <p>

                    Ultimately the Beasts came out on top , followed by Demons and Puppets. Each faction also elected a Leader and a MVP based on performance. Near the end of Faction War, it was tocuhed on by the team that three separate new tokens would be awarded to different "winners" from the war. The contents/utility of the tokens are yet to be known.

                  </p>

In Town Halls and discussions, the Team has discussed fleshing out the trading card collection, as well as launching the long-teased "Gallery" and "Store" on their website. The team has also been hard at working legally filing IP rights and finding a talented animation team. We can't wait to see how Studio Sekai grows!</p>

                <p>Also teased in several Town Halls, the Studio Sekai team is now expanding! As holders we have to remember that this is more than an NFT collection, it is a blossiming animation studio and brand that must be built on the business side as well.</p>

                <p>That being said, the team is planning for a massive art department expansion, and are hiring multiple different types of artists along with a finance expert right off the bat.</p>

                <p>Here are the current available positions as of 12/1/2022:</p>

                <p>There was a lot of doubt in the air this month as to if the team could really deliver, and if they could generate consistent, entertaining material while we waited for their big plans to come together. After reading through everything that has taken place this month you can plainly see how much has really happened with Isekai Meta. </p>
                <p>We have seen updates and additions to Discord, the IM website, new contests and fan creations, invaluable alpha and WL spots, new tokens and contracts, and an array of incredible art all over the span of 30 days. Not to mention, the birth of a company! If you've lost faith in this project and are reading this, I urge you to be patient as this is only the beginning. Happy Holidays everyone!</p>

                  <h6 class="subHead">Faction Wars</h6>

                    <p>
                      Faction Wars were an exciting attempt at a series of Discord minigames, puzzles and challenges. It brought community members together in the form of 9 different factions - with a twist! Humans had the ability to pledge their allegiance to any faction, and owners of multiple tokens had the choice of multiple factions. This was the first real token mechanic we have seen from the team on their website, and it had a unique experience for each faction.
                      The main component of the war was the Sekai Hunt, and brought these new-found groups together to earn points for an unknown prize. Each day was made up of a challenge that unlocked a riddle upon completion. The first team to complete the riddle earned 100 points, followed by the second team at 90 points, and so on. Each quest was also worth 20 points and could be completed at any time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      These challenges kept us busy and ultimately led to a really fun environment in Discord. Here are the final point toals from the Sekai Hunt:
                    </p>

                    <p>

                      <ol>
                        <li>Beasts: 963 points</li>
                        <li>Demons: 844 points</li>
                        <li>Puppets: 794 points</li>
                        <li>Humans: 755 points</li>
                        <li>Jellies: 714 points</li>
                        <li>Mechs: 628 points</li>
                        <li>Angels: 474 points</li>
                        <li>Zombies: 452 points</li>
                        <li>Dragons: 275 points</li>
                      </ol>

                    </p>

                    <p>

                      Ultimately the Beasts came out on top , followed by Demons and Puppets. Each faction also elected a Leader and a MVP based on performance. Near the end of Faction War, it was tocuhed on by the team that three separate new tokens would be awarded to different "winners" from the war. The contents/utility of the tokens are yet to be known.

                    </p>

                    <p>This event was paired with its own set of lore and art which accompanied our challenges. We have yet to see the effects of the war on the story, but we have heard that our efforts may have changed the course of history!</p>
