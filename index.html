                <h6 class="subHead">Faction Wars</h6>

                  <p>
                    Faction Wars were an exciting attempt at a series of Discord minigames, puzzles and challenges. It brought community members together in the form of 9 different factions - with a twist! Humans had the ability to pledge their allegiance to any faction, and owners of multiple tokens had the choice of multiple factions. This was the first real token mechanic we have seen from the team on their website, and it had a unique experience for each faction.
                    The main component of the war was the Sekai Hunt, and brought these new-found groups together to earn points for an unknown prize. Each day was made up of a challenge that unlocked a riddle upon completion. The first team to complete the riddle earned 100 points, followed by the second team at 90 points, and so on. Each quest was also worth 20 points and could be completed at any time.
                  </p>
                  <img id="sideModalPic" src="img/hunt.png" width="90%" alt="">
                  <p>
                    These challenges kept us busy and ultimately led to a really fun environment in Discord. Here are the final point toals from the Sekai Hunt:
                  </p>

                  <p>

                    <ol>
                      <li>Beasts: 963 points</li>
                      <li>Demons: 844 points</li>
                      <li>Puppets: 794 points</li>
                      <li>Humans: 755 points</li>
                      <li>Jellies: 714 points</li>
                      <li>Mechs: 628 points</li>
                      <li>Angels: 474 points</li>
                      <li>Zombies: 452 points</li>
                      <li>Dragons: 275 points</li>
                    </ol>

                  </p>

                  <p>

                    Ultimately the Beasts came out on top , followed by Demons and Puppets. Each faction also elected a Leader and a MVP based on performance. Near the end of Faction War, it was tocuhed on by the team that three separate new tokens would be awarded to different "winners" from the war. The contents/utility of the tokens are yet to be known.

                  </p>

                  <p>This event was paired with its own set of lore and art which accompanied our challenges. We have yet to see the effects of the war on the story, but we have heard that our efforts may have changed the course of history!</p>

              <p>We're not sure what the future holds for Isekai Meta - but there is so much potential. In Town Halls and discussions, the Team has discussed fleshing out the trading card collection, as well as launching the long-teased "Gallery" and "Store" on their website. The team has also been hard at working legally filing IP rights and finding a talented animation team. We can't wait to see how Studio Sekai grows!</p>

                <p>The Discord chat bot was updated this month to include 3 new commands for additional fun and interaction:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li style="font-weight: bold">!token (TOKENID)<li>
                    <p>Shows the NFT and the last sale, along with the link on OpenSea and X2Y2</p>

                <p>A lot of projects have an alpha channel, but ours has gone to the next level. This month, PL officialy launched Isekai Alpha, a Discord and Twitter feed with an endless supply of alpha calls, whitelist spots and giveaways. PL has done an incredible job networking with other projects, and has benefitted holders greatly through both new token ownership and protential profits.</p>

                <p>Throughout November alone, Isekai Alpha has made connections with 30+ projects and gained over 1,000 followers on Twitter. This is just another great reason to be a part of the community.</p>

In just over a month, the team has prepared an elegant office space for what looks like a comfortable 10-15 people. Want to work here? Read on...</p>

                <p>We have seen updates and additions to Discord, the IM website, new contests and fan creations, invaluable alpha and WL spots, new tokens and contracts, and an array of incredible art all over the span of 30 days.

                    <p>
                      Faction Wars were an exciting attempt at a series of Discord minigames, puzzles and challenges. It brought community members together in the form of 9 different factions - with a twist! Humans had the ability to pledge their allegiance to any faction, and owners of multiple tokens had the choice of multiple factions. This was the first real token mechanic we have seen from the team on their website, and it had a unique experience for each faction.
                      The main component of the war was the Sekai Hunt, and brought these new-found groups together to earn points for an unknown prize. Each day was made up of a challenge that unlocked a riddle upon completion. The first team to complete the riddle earned 100 points, followed by the second team at 90 points, and so on. Each quest was also worth 20 points and could be completed at any time.
                    </p>
                    <img id="sideModalPic" src="img/hunt.png" width="90%" alt="">
                    <p>
                      These challenges kept us busy and ultimately led to a really fun environment in Discord. Here are the final point toals from the Sekai Hunt:
                    </p>

                    <p>

                      <ol>
                        <li>Beasts: 963 points</li>
                        <li>Demons: 844 points</li>
                        <li>Puppets: 794 points</li>
                        <li>Humans: 755 points</li>
                        <li>Jellies: 714 points</li>
                        <li>Mechs: 628 points</li>
                        <li>Angels: 474 points</li>
                        <li>Zombies: 452 points</li>
                        <li>Dragons: 275 points</li>
                      </ol>

                    </p>

                    <p>

                      Ultimately the Beasts came out on top , followed by Demons and Puppets. Each faction also elected a Leader and a MVP based on performance. Near the end of Faction War, it was tocuhed on by the team that three separate new tokens would be awarded to different "winners" from the war. The contents/utility of the tokens are yet to be known.

                    </p>

                    <p>This event was paired with its own set of lore and art which accompanied our challenges. We have yet to see the effects of the war on the story, but we have heard that our efforts may have changed the course of history!</p>

                <p>We're not sure what the future holds for Isekai Meta - but there is so much potential. In Town Halls and discussions, the Team has discussed fleshing out the trading card collection, as well as launching the long-teased "Gallery" and "Store" on their website. The team has also been hard at working legally filing IP rights and finding a talented animation team. We can't wait to see how Studio Sekai grows!</p>
